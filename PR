The reason this is a meaningful improvement to the current repo is because the code in python will be available, and the members do not have to go into the full code and look for different features. The main features I was able to document are common, wallet, and coin. In order to ensure, this is running smoothly, they can go into this code directly and find bugs/ make the system better,
