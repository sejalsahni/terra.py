My thought process for this request was to read over the Terra-js documentation. 
This documentation is very different as it highlights the topics and states the code that is needed. 
After reading this documentation, I visited the code for Terra.js, and saw which parts of the code were included for documentation as only the most important/key features are needed. 
I am assuming this is to increase runtime efficiency. If a member of terra team is working on the wallet, they can see the wallet code and, make improvement on that code specifically. 
It took quite some time to understand this code better.
